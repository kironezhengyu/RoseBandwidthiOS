Since RoseBandwidth uses the SettingsViewController submodule, to clone
everything needed to build the app you should perform:

git clone https://github.com/lithium3141/RoseBandwidth.git
cd RoseBandwidth
git submodule init
git submodule update

After that, you can use xcodebuild from the command-line or the Xcode GUI
to build RoseBandwidth.
